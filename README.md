🏠 House Rent Price Analysis Using Python
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a real estate rental dataset to identify key factors influencing house rent prices.
Using Python and data analytics techniques, the project explores how rent varies based on city, house type, furnishing status, and property size.

🎯 Objective

To analyze rental price patterns across different cities

To understand the impact of house features on rent

To extract insights that help tenants and property owners make data-driven decisions

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about rental properties with the following attributes:

Column Name	Description
house_type	Type of property (Apartment, Villa, etc.)
locality	Area or locality of the property
city	City where the property is located
area	Size of the house (sq ft)
beds	Number of bedrooms
bathrooms	Number of bathrooms
balconies	Number of balconies
furnishing	Furnishing status
area_rate	Rent per square foot
rent	Monthly rent
🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Standardized column names for consistency

Checked and handled missing values

Ensured correct data types for numerical columns

Removed invalid records (e.g., zero-bedroom houses)

🔧 Feature Engineering

Created a new metric rent_per_bed to analyze rent distribution per bedroom

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following analyses were performed:

Average rent by city

Rent comparison by house type

Impact of furnishing on rent prices

Relationship between house area and rent

Correlation analysis between numerical features

📈 Visualizations

Bar charts for city-wise and house-type-wise rent comparison

Scatter plot to analyze area vs rent relationship

Clear and simple plots for better interpretability

🔍 Key Insights

Rental prices vary significantly across cities

Furnished properties command higher rent

Rent increases with property size (area)

House type and furnishing status strongly influence pricing

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical data analytics skills including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
The insights derived from this analysis can support better decision-making in the real estate rental market.

📌 Future Improvements
